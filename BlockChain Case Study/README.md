# HIVE

HIVE Blockchain Technologies is the first publicly traded crypto miner, listing on the Toronto Venture Exchange back in 2017, under the ticker symbol HIVE. The company uses 100% green energy to mine both Bitcoin and Ethereum since day one. HIVE utilizes green energy-powered data centre facilities in Canada, Sweden and Iceland, which produces newly minted digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum continuously on the cloud.

HIVE is dedicated to mitigating their environmental impact and have built facilities in jurisdictions with access to relatively low-cost green/renewable energy. With less enviromental impact, HIVE is in the pursuit to build operations that are sustainable both for the present and the future.

## Why This Matters

Bitcoin alone is infamous for wasting enough electricity to add 40 million tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere a year. Depending on bitcoin’s cost (a higher price attracts more miners), its global network sucks up between 8 and 15 gigawatts of continuous power, according to Cambridge. Exactly how much carbon is released into the atmosphere by bitcoin mining depends entirely on what energy source is used. Ethereum, on the other hand, is transitioning next year from “proof of work” to  “proof of stake,” which cuts energy use by 99.95%. But bitcoin isn’t going anywhere.

Which is why HIVE is very concerned with the environmental impact that mining can cause to the planet. With this they firmly stand by using technologies that are powered with renewable energy.

## Why This May be Interesting

HIVE uses high powered computing assets to mine cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Bitcoin on the cloud. They provide shareholders with exposure to the operating margins of digital currency mining as well as a portfolio of crypto-coins.

Not like other blockchain companies that provide cloud mining services to customers who lease mining capacity for a fixed period of time to mine their own coins. HIVE, directly operates its facilities and is itself a business operator. They provide shareholders with exposure to the margins of mining, together with the price performance of a portfolio of crypto coins held and managed by HIVE.

Leasing hash is finite and non-transferrable. This is the main distinction from HIVE.
